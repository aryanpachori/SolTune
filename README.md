SolTune: Where Music Meets the Cosmos 🎶🚀<br/>

Welcome to SolTune—the app that’s out of this world! Here, you can create and join spaces, jam to your favorite tunes, and vote like a cosmic DJ. 🌌✨<br/>

🚀 What is SolTune?<br/>

Think of SolTune as your personal space station where you can create a single space at a time, join multiple spaces, and control the intergalactic music playlist. No need for a space suit, just your love for music and a dash of adventure! 🎧🌠<br/>

🌟 Features<br/>

Create One Space at a Time: Because even the universe has limits, and you can only handle one space at a time. 🌌<br/>
Join Multiple Spaces: Experience a variety of cosmic vibes—join as many spaces as you like and enjoy the music! 🎵<br/>
Vote on Songs: Cast your votes on tunes using the Spotify or YouTube API. Upvote or downvote to create the ultimate playlist. 🚀🎶<br/>
Space Status: Each space has a status—LIVE or ENDED. It’s like a space mission that’s either ongoing or retired. 📡✨<br/>
